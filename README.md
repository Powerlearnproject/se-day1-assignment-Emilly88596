#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. This involves design, development,testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages for example C++..
Establishment of Sofware enginering as one of the disciplines for study.This was in the year 1960.
The arise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:-This refers to the gathering of information and documenting the user needs and system requirements.
Design:- This step involves creating high-level abd detailed deesigns of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation:-This is where the codes are written and software built according to the designs specifications.
Testing:-This is where testings are done to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment:- This is where the software is now released to the end users.
Maintenance:-This is where routine and continuous support, updates, and enhancements  are conducted to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows the distict phases of software development chronologically from the requirement phase to the maintenance phase.It is ideal when projects do not have  complicated requirements.
Agile methodology is the use of Iterativ and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration, and responding to change. This is I deal for complicated projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software is of good quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs helps programmers develop software code efficiently hence increases the developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. An example is Visual Studio
VCS tracks every alteration to a file or set of files, enabling developers to go back to previous versions and collaborate effectively. An example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements:- The requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. The solution here is to assess the complexity of the project inorder to determine the right methodology to employ.
Technical debts which can accrue from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions which may then impede future development efforts and increase maintenance cost. It is essential to determine the customers pottential and budget inorder to choose development that may be sustainable. 
Tight Deadlines, this is where there is pressure to deliver software products on schedule which can lead to rushed development and compromised quality. In this case it is important to prioritize tasks and regularly reassess the project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing refers to testing indivual componenents or modules of the software to ensure they are working as desired.
Integration testing refers to testing the interactions between different components  or subsystems. This is important to ensure harmony of the subsystems
System testing refers to testing the entire system as a whole. This is important to ensure it meets the standards required.
Acceptance refers to testing the software to ensure it met the customer needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting of quesions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models
The importance of prompt engineering is that it helps make questions clear and specific for the AI to understand what exactly one needs.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Promtp:- What in Analytics
Improved Version:- What is data analytics in the context of data management for data scientists.
